Adds a reviews/rating section to BuddyPress groups. As seen on the buddypress.org/extend/plugins

== Description ==

BP Group Reviews adds a new tab to your BuddyPress groups, where users can leave reviews and star ratings for the group.

The guts of the plugin were written by Andy Peatling for use on the [Extend section of buddypress.org](http://buddypress.org/extend/plugins). His code was adapted and expanded into this plugin by Boone Gorges. All praise goes to Andy, all blame for things broken goes to Boone :)
